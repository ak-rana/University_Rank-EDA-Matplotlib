## Dataset EDA Implications

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) can provide important insights into the university ranking dataset. By visualizing the data and identifying correlations between variables, researchers can gain a better understanding of the factors that influence university rankings. For example, by comparing the quality of education and alumni employment variables, researchers can identify universities that excel in both areas. Similarly, by analyzing the relationship between publications and citations, researchers can identify universities that have a high research output and impact.

## Insights and Predictions from the Dataset
By analyzing the university ranking dataset, researchers can make valuable predictions and insights about the performance of universities. For example, by analyzing the trend in rankings over time, researchers can identify universities that are likely to improve or decline in the future. Similarly, by analyzing the performance of universities in different regions, researchers can identify the factors that contribute to their success and make predictions about the future performance of universities in those regions.
